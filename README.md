Open source RAW PHP framework. 


# PHP FRAMEWORK

An open source project for a fully capable website with integrated login, blog, pages and additional features typically found on modern websites without using any frameworks, packages, or external code or resources. 

This project is 100% raw PHP, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

With web-dev technologies becoming more and more complicated, I wanted to created a website similar to how it was done in the early 2000s to see what it's like to make the entire website including Authentication, CRUD and multi-user support completely from scratch. 

This is a continuously evolving project, so the code in this repository may be a bit random at times with a mix of OOP and procedural, as well as things that are clearly not usable (such as cleartext passwords), but I hope this could be a useful tool to some people and if anyone wants to fork this to improve or add some functionality that would be great! 

!!! If you would like to contribute to this repository please only use raw code (no frameworks, CDNs, plugins, etc).
